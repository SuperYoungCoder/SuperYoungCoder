- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SuperYoungCoder
- I am a professional system operator at the nuclear power station in Darlington.
During my engineering career, I have taken on several different responsibilities, from system optimization to safety and regulation coordination.
As a system automation expert, I analyzed the input and output data from flow meters and sensors across the station. I also worked closely with the key stakeholders
to keep the station at its optimal production level. Ensuring the safety of the nuclear power station is not a one-person job; it requires all personnel to
work collaboratively in harmony. Since the station comprises many different departments, as is often the case, it is paramount to maintain concise communication
between the departments. In my latest position, as safety and regulation coordinator, I was the point of contact to support all personnel in navigating the complex
communication channels to keep the station safe and operating optimally. As the coordinator responsible for everyone's safety and the station's health, I faced
many challenges in keeping everyone on the same page. Such challenges often arise from differences and misunderstandings among colleagues. Under such stressful
situations, I learned that patience and communication always go a long way. All of this has helped me become the person I am today, so I hold the experience
in high regard.

- This year, I completed bachelor degree of statistics at York University. As the current world increasignly relies on information and is data-driven,
statistics has been of particular intrest to me. Hence, I embarked on the journey of learning statistics.
Throughout this new joureny, I have enjoyed learning how mathematical equations and theories are derived from calculus to allow us to make inferences about data.
However, I know that mathematical equations and theories alone will not save the day. Although addressing and analyzing emerging problems with high accuracy is very
important, these problems can only be solved when proper solutions are in place to support them.
